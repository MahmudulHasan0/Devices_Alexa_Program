# Devices_Alexa_Program
This custom program to turn on/off a lamp and turn a servo a certain angle using Alexa, Raspberry Pi, and the ESP8266 through the MQTT protocol. 

Will eventually add more devices to control. Servo will be used to make a linear actuator that will be 3D printed to control a sliding light dimmer. 

Will also make a website with Node.js that will be able to control the devices 

# USAGE

* "Alexa start My Devices"

* "Alexa, tell my lamp to turn {On/Off}" -> Will turn lamp on or off

* "Alexa, tell my servo to turn {Left/Right}" -> Will move servo to angle 0 or 180

* "Alexa, tell my servo to turn {Angle} degrees" -> Will move servo to whatever angle you said
