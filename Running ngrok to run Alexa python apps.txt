Run this program and act like a server with nrok. 
The set up on alexa develop and test on alexa device.
ngrok point to the skill handler. get back https endpoint. put into alexa dev to test it out

1) Download ngrok and unzip the ngrok.exe file to someplace (i unziped it to this folder to make things easier)
   https://ngrok.com/download
2) go to the ngrok file u just unzipped and Run it and put in the command:
   WINDOWS: 
      ngrok http 5000   //nrok to call it. what protocol? http. what port? flask development port uses 5000 we have a http and https port now  for amazon
   LINUX:
      ./ngrok http 5000 
3) Alexa Developer Account with same amazon acount as your Alexa: https://developer.amazon.com 
   a) Alexa Tab -> Alexa Skills Kit -> Create SKill
   b) Invocation Name = what ur user will say to invoke the app
   c) Make your own intents. look at your @ask.intent("__") names from the python script you wrote. make a intent in the alexa dev accout for each of these
   
   d) After all is done, go to endpoints -> HTTPs -> same for the default and North Ameria options. 
      Type in the https thing u got from ngrok(this url basically forward this url to the local url): https://829ecf5f.ngrok.io
      But since my endpoint is "/reddit_reader" it will be: https://829ecf5f.ngrok.io/reddit_reader
   e) The certification is, since im using ngrok, " my dev endpoint is a sub-domain ...."
