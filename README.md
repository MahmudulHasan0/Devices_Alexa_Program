# Devices_Alexa_Program
This custom program to turn on/off a lamp and turn a servo a certain angle using Alexa, Raspberry Pi, and the ESP8266 through the MQTT protocol. 

Will eventually add more devices to control. Servo will be used to make a linear actuator that will be 3D printed to control a sliding light dimmer. 

Will also make a website with Node.js that will be able to control the devices
